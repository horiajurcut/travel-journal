			<b>Travel Journal</b> helps you plan your entire trip in under 30 seconds. All you need to do is fill out a simple form and based on your choices, we collect information from various sources like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/business/placesforbusiness/">Google Places</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.expedia.com/">Expedia</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://forecast.io/">Forecast.io</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/views">Google Street View</a>. Sounds amazing, right? Let's start by choosing your destination. Haven't you always dreamt about visiting <b>Paris</b> or <b>Barcelona</b>? Now you can! Just head over to the <a target="_blank" href="/plan">New Destination</a> page.

			The next step in creating your Journal page (plan) is choosing a future date as a time reference for your trip. Why do we need this information, you ask? The answer is we discovered time travelling, but don't tell anyone yet. <b>Travel Journal</b> searches for available hotel rooms, events and weather forecasts around this given time frame. You can go as far as one year into the future. Remember, hope for the best and plan for the worst!

			We're very keen on collecting information tailored to your preferences. That's why, we built a simple and user friendly interface where you can select the type of places and events you enjoy the most. They're all just one click away. Or one tap away. Yes, you heard me, our interface is responsive and works well on other devices than your laptop (go ahead and try it on the new <b>Nexus 7</b> if you don't believe us).

			The <a target="_blank" href="/plans">Plans</a> page is where you're entire collection of cities resides. Every plan you've ever made is here. Similar to an <b>Encyclopedia</b>, but tailored to your preferences. Each and every one of these cards tells a story, your story. As you can see, it might take some time to gather all the information required to build a journal, but rest assured that once we're finished, you'll be the first to know. The status of each card changes automatically and you will be notified by e-mail once everything is ready. Even the website icon changes, showing the number of recently completed plans. Don't forget, sharing is caring! You can share your stories on <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+Gcdc2013traveljournalAppspotTJ">Google+</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelJournalApp">Facebook</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/TravelJApp">Twitter</a>.

			Probably our most important feature is the <b>Journal</b> page itself. Our main focus is not just delivering the most accurate information. We want each and every one of our users to be able to tell their story, in the most amazing way possible!. Through design and typography, we managed to build a unique user experience. You can share your stories with friends on <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+Gcdc2013traveljournalAppspotTJ">Google+</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelJournalApp">Facebook</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/TravelJApp">Twitter</a>. We also integrated <a target="_blank" href="http://disqus.com/">DISQUS</a>, so you can share opinions with other fellow travellers. Depending on the information available, you will be able to browse through a variety of places, hotels (with relevant booking information), events, maps, reviews, weather forecast, videos and books. We even added a Translate button, so you don't feel lost when reading reviews in other languages.
